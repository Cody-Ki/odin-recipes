HTML Odin Project

Created a simple HTML website to showcase some recipes to show of information learned in the foundations track of The Odin project so far.
To include linking to webpages, correct website directory layouts, image linking, and the use of git commits and pushes.
This has all been mostly review for myself but it is nice to get back to learning as it has been a while. The use of git and GitHub has been
completely new so far however.
